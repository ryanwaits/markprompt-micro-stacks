This is a [Markprompt](https://markprompt.com) starter template based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies via NPM, Yarn or PNPN:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm dev
```

Then, rename the `.env.sample` file in the project root to `.env`, and set the value of `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_KEY` to your project's public API key. This key can be found in your Markprompt dashboard, under project settings.

Next, publish your project to a public host. A great option is [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new). Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

Then, add your host to the list of whitelisted domains in your project settings.

Once deployed, your prompt is now ready to answer questions!
